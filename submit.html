<p> Submission Policy: </p>
<ul>
  <li> Submissions should be a maximum of four pages, plus any number of pages for references and supplementary material. We ask authors to use the supplementary material only for minor details that do not fit in the main paper. </li>
  <li> Papers should be fully anonymized for double-blind review. </li>
  <li>Papers should use the ICML style file</a>.</li>
  <li> Dual submission policy: we welcome submissions that have been published or are currently under review at other venues, including both full conference papers and workshops. However, all submissions should be shortened to four pages. </li>
  <li>Evaluation criteria: Papers will be reviewed for topicality, clarity, correctness, and novelty; however, we welcome submissions which are still work-in-progress. Papers which are longer than four pages, clearly off-topic, or not anonymized will be rejected without review.</li>
</ul>
